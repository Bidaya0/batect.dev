title: "A big week for Batect: the Thoughtworks Tech Radar and 500 stars"

It's been a big few days for Batect, with two significant milestones achieved:

- Batect has once again been featured on [the Thoughtworks Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). It has
  been placed in "trial", the ring one step from "adopt".

- Batect's GitHub repository broke through 500 stars.

I'd like to thank everyone who's helped get Batect to this point - whether you've simply tried "hello, world" with Batect, submitted some feedback
or advocated for its adoption on your teams, Batect exists for its users, and I'm incredibly grateful for all the support and encouragement
I've received from every one of you.

There's still much more to do, and many ways Batect could be further improved - watch this space!

_Disclosure: while I am employed by Thoughtworks, I am not involved in the selection process for entries on the Radar, nor did
I nominate Batect for inclusion. I did provide a review of the entry description prior to its publication. See "how do we build the Radar?"
on [the frequently asked questions page](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq-and-more) for more information on the process
behind the Technology Radar._
