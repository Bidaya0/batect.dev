**tl;dr**: run `./batect --upgrade` to upgrade to Batect v0.69.0 or later to ensure Batect continues to work after May 1
:::tip

Bintray [announced on February 3](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/) that it
will be shutting down on May 1, 2021.

Batect's wrapper script (`batect` on macOS and Linux, and `batect.cmd` on Windows) downloads Batect from Bintray if it has not
already been cached on your machine.

After Bintray's shutdown on May 1, downloading Batect from Bintray will no longer work. Batect v0.69.0 introduces a new download
server (`updates.batect.dev`) which does not rely on Bintray.

In order to continue using Batect without any issues after May 1, you must do one of the following:

## Option 1: upgrade to v0.69.0 or later

To switch to the new server, the easiest thing to do is to upgrade with `./batect --upgrade`. This will automatically update
your wrapper script to the new version that uses the new download server.

## Option 2: remain on an old version and switch to new server

The new download server also supports old versions. If you need to remain on an older version, make the following changes
in your project's copy of the wrapper script:

```diff title="batect"
-DOWNLOAD_URL_ROOT=${BATECT_DOWNLOAD_URL_ROOT:-"https://dl.bintray.com/batect/batect"}
-DOWNLOAD_URL=${BATECT_DOWNLOAD_URL:-"$DOWNLOAD_URL_ROOT/$VERSION/bin/batect-$VERSION.jar"}
+DOWNLOAD_URL_ROOT=${BATECT_DOWNLOAD_URL_ROOT:-"https://updates.batect.dev/v1/files"}
+DOWNLOAD_URL=${BATECT_DOWNLOAD_URL:-"$DOWNLOAD_URL_ROOT/$VERSION/batect-$VERSION.jar"}
```

```diff title="batect.cmd"
-$DownloadUrlRoot = getValueOrDefault $env:BATECT_DOWNLOAD_URL_ROOT "https://dl.bintray.com/batect/batect"^
+$DownloadUrlRoot = getValueOrDefault $env:BATECT_DOWNLOAD_URL_ROOT "https://updates.batect.dev/v1/files"^


 $UrlEncodedVersion = [Uri]::EscapeDataString($Version)^


-$DownloadUrl = getValueOrDefault $env:BATECT_DOWNLOAD_URL "$DownloadUrlRoot/$UrlEncodedVersion/bin/batect-$UrlEncodedVersion.jar"^
+$DownloadUrl = getValueOrDefault $env:BATECT_DOWNLOAD_URL "$DownloadUrlRoot/$UrlEncodedVersion/batect-$UrlEncodedVersion.jar"^
```
