I've just published two RFCs covering significant enhancements to Batect:

- [new expression syntax](https://github.com/batect/batect/pull/990)
- [bundle scoping](https://github.com/batect/batect/pull/991)

The RFC process is intended to allow anyone with an interest in Batect to get involved and help shape it
to suit their needs, so please don't be shy! Any comments, suggestions, questions or constructive criticism
are more than welcome.
