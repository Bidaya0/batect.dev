title: 2021 user survey - win an AU$50 voucher!

I'm once again running a survey to collect feedback on Batect, and this year I'm offering an AU$50 voucher (or equivalent in your local currency) as a prize to encourage responses.

The survey is available at: https://forms.gle/1S7a7C7zfPzi39vN6

If you're using Batect on your team at the moment, I would be super grateful if you could also share this within your team - the more responses I get, the better feedback I get,
and the better I can make Batect.
