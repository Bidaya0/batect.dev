A project is the top-level concept in Batect: it is the root for all configuration, including [tasks](tasks.md) and [containers](containers.md).

A project is configured in a [configuration file](../reference/config/overview.md), usually called `batect.yml`. This configuration can be split
into smaller files with [includes and bundles](includes-and-bundles.md).
