title: Keep Batect and your configuration up-to-date
---

import Renovate from "../using-batect-with/tools/renovate.md";

A single Batect project is made up of many components that are versioned independently:

- Batect itself
- the images your project uses
- the bundles your project uses

Each of these need to be kept up to date to take advantage of bug fixes, new features and performance and security improvements.

## Automating updates

### Renovate

<Renovate />

## Manually checking for updates

### Batect itself

Batect automatically checks for updates to itself in the background, and prompts you at the start of a task if a new version is
available, for example:

```text
Version 1.2.3 of Batect is now available (you have 1.1.4).
To upgrade to the latest version, run './batect --upgrade'.
For more information, visit https://github.com/batect/batect/releases/1.2.3.
```

To update (or check for updates immediately), run `./batect --upgrade`.

### Image and bundle references

There is no built-in support for identifying out-of-date image or bundle references.
